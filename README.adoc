= Ammitto UN Sanctions Data Repository

== Purpose

This repository stores downloaded and processed sanctions data from the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Consolidated List.

The data is maintained by the Ammitto project and used by the `ammitto` Ruby
gem for querying international sanctions information.

== Legal Basis

The UN sanctions are established by the United Nations Security Council under
Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Key aspects include:

* Security Council resolutions creating sanctions regimes
* Sanctions committees established by the Security Council
* Targeted sanctions against individuals and entities

The consolidated list is maintained by the UN Security Council and includes
designations from multiple sanctions committees.

== Data Source

* **Authority**: United Nations Security Council
* **API Endpoint**: https://scsanctions.un.org/resources/xml/en/consolidated.xml
* **Format**: XML
* **Update Frequency**: As changes occur in UN sanctions regimes
* **Official Source**: https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/consolidated-list

== Directory Descriptions

downloaded/:: Contains raw XML data files as downloaded from the UN API.
The primary file is `un_sanctions_list.xml` which contains the complete
consolidated list.

processed/:: Contains individual YAML files, one per sanction entity.
Files are named using the pattern `{primary-name}-{index}.yaml` where
index ensures uniqueness for entities with similar names.

reference-docs/:: Contains reference documentation about the UN sanctions
schema and data formats.

update.log:: Log file tracking when data was last updated with timestamps.

== Sanctions Committees

The UN Consolidated List includes designations from multiple sanctions
committees:

* 1718 Committee (DPRK)
* 1988 Committee (Afghanistan)
* 1267/1989 Committee (Al-Qaeda/ISIS)
* 1518 Committee (Iraq)
* 1533 Committee (DRC)
* 1591 Committee (Sudan)
* 1970 Committee (Libya)
* 2206 Committee (South Sudan)
* 2309 Committee (Haiti)
* 2664 Committee (Mali)
* And others as established by the Security Council

== Updating Data

Data can be updated using the ammitto gem:

[source,shell]
----
# From the ammitto gem directory
bundle exec ruby exe/ammitto fetch un --format yaml --output-dir ./processed
----

Or via the adapters repository:

[source,shell]
----
# From the adapters/ directory
ruby adapter.rb
----

== YAML Schema

Each processed YAML file follows the schema defined in
`ammitto/lib/ammitto/sources/un/` using Lutaml::Model.

.Example YAML structure
[source,yaml]
----
names:
  - "PRIMARY NAME"
  - "ALIAS 1"
entity_type: person  # or "organization"
source: un
country: Country Name
birthdate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
identifications:
  - type: "National ID"
    number: "XXX123456"
addresses:
  - street: "Street Address"
    city: "City"
    country: "Country"
----

== Entity Types

The UN sanctions list contains the following entity types:

Person:: Individual persons subject to sanctions
Organization:: Legal entities, companies, and organizations

== Knowledge Graph Integration

This repository's processed YAML data feeds into the Ammitto knowledge graph.

When the harmonization process runs:

[source,shell]
----
# Auto-detect all data-* repos and harmonize
ammitto harmonize --scan --sources-dir /path/to/repos --output-dir ./api/v1
----

The un data is transformed into:

* Individual JSON-LD nodes in `api/v1/node/entity/un/{id}.jsonld`
* Sanction entries in `api/v1/node/entry/un/{id}.jsonld`
* Lightweight search index entries
* Facet counts for filtering
