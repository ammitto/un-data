remark: 'ADF founder and leader, Jamil Mukulu (CDi.015), was arrested in Dar es Salaam,
  Tanzania in April 2015. He was subsequently extradited to Kampala, Uganda in July
  2015. As of June 2016, Mukulu is reportedly being held in a police detention cell
  awaiting his trial. Seka Baluku (CDi.036) succeeded Jamil Mukulu (CDi.015) as the
  overall leader of the ADF. As highlighted in several reports from the Group of Experts
  on the DRC (S/2015/19, S/2015/797, S/2016/1102, S/2017/672, S/2018/531, S/2019/469,
  S/2019/974, S/2020/482), the ADF, including under Seka Baluku’s leadership, continued
  to commit the repeated targeting, killing and maiming, rape and other sexual violence,
  abduction of civilians, including children, as well as attacks on villages and health
  facilities, in particular in Mamove, Beni territory, on 12 and 24 February 2019,
  and Mantumbi, Beni territory, on 5 December 2019 and 30 January 2020, as well as
  the continuous recruitment and use of children during attacks and for forced labour
  in Beni territory in the DRC since at least 2015. INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special
