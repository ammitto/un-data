remark: "Associated with Al-Qaida (QDe.004). Brought Syrian and foreign Al-Qaida in
  Iraq\n                (QDe.115) and Asbat al-Ansar (QDe.007) fighters, along with
  other foreign Al-Qaida\n                operatives, to join local elements in Syrian
  Arab Republic to carry out terrorist\n                and guerrilla operations there.
  Previously associated with the Islamic State in Iraq\n                and the Levant
  (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), and its leader Ibrahim\n                Awwad
  Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299) but separated from that group in\n                2013.
  In Jul. 2016, Abu Mohammed Al-Jawlani (QDi.317), the leader of Al-Nusrah Front\n
  \               for the People of the Levant, announced the group had changed its
  name to Jabhat\n                Fath al-Sham and was no longer affiliated with any
  external entity. Despite the\n                announcement and attempts to distinguish
  itself from Al-Nusrah Front for the People\n                of the Levant, the group
  remains aligned with Al-Qaida and continues to carry out\n                terrorist
  operations under this new name. In January 2017, Al-Nusrah Front created\n                Hay’at
  Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a vehicle to advance its position in the Syrian\n                insurgency
  and further its own goals as Al-Qaida’s affiliate in Syria. Previously\n                listed
  between 30 May 2013 and 13 May 2014 as an aka of Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115).\n                Review
  pursuant to Security Council resolution 2368 (2017) was concluded on 15 November
  2021.            \n             INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web
