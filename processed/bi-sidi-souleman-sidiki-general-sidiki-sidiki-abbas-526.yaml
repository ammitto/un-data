remark: Bi Sidi Souleman leads the Central African Republic (CAR)-based militia group
  Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation (3R) which has killed, tortured, raped, and
  displaced civilians and engaged in arms trafficking, illegal taxation activities,
  and warfare with other militias since its creation in 2015. Bi Sidi Souleman himself
  has also participated in torture. On 6 February 2019, 3R signed the Political Agreement
  for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR but has engaged in acts violating the Agreement
  and remains a threat to the peace, stability and security of the CAR. For instance,
  on 21 May 2019, 3R killed 34 unarmed civilians in three villages, summarily executing
  adult males. Bi Sidi Souleman openly confirmed to a UN Entity that he had ordered
  3R elements to the villages on the date of the attacks, but did not admit to giving
  the orders for 3R to kill.  In December 2020, after having joined a coalition of
  armed groups established to disrupt the electoral process, Bi Sidi Souleman was
  reportedly killed during fighting.  INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice
