remark: 'Registered owner of DPRK tanker CHON MA SAN. DPRK-flagged CHON MA SAN prepared
  for likely ship-to-ship transfer operations in late January 2018. The master of
  the DPRK-flagged motor tanker YU JONG 2 reported on 18 November 2017 to an unidentified
  DPRK-based controller that the vessel was avoiding a storm in advance of a ship-to-ship
  transfer.  The master suggested that the YU JONG 2 load fuel oil before the DPRK-flagged
  tanker CHON MA SAN since the CHON MA SANâ€™s larger size was better suited to conduct
  ship-to-ship transfers in a storm.  After the CHON MA SAN loaded fuel oil from a
  vessel, the YU JONG 2 loaded 1,168 kiloliters of fuel oil on 19 November 2017 through
  a ship-to-ship transfer operation. IMO number: 5936312.'
