  The Korea Heungjin Trading Company is used by KOMID for trading purposes.
  We suspect it has been involved in supplying missile-related goods to Iran’s Shahid
  Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG). Heungjin has been associated with KOMID, and, more
  specifically, KOMID’s procurement office. Heungjin has been used to procure an advanced
  digital controller with applications in missile design. KOMID was designated by the
  Committee in April 2009 and is the DPRK’s primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods
  and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. The Security
  Council designated SHIG in resolution 1737 (2006) as an entity involved in Iran’s
  ballistic missile programme.
