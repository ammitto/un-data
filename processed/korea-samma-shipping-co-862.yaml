remark: A DPRK-flagged tanker, SAM MA 2 owned by Korea Samma Shipping Company, conducted
  a ship-to-ship transfer of oil and fabricated documents in mid-October 2017, loading
  almost 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in one transaction.  The ship master was instructed
  to erase SAMMA SHIPPING and the Korean words found on the ship’s seal and instead
  put “Hai Xin You 606” to mask its identity as a DPRK vessel.
