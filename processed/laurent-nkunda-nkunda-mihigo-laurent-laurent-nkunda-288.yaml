  Defense, 2006; Senior Officer, Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-G), 1998-2006;
  Officer Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), 1992-1998. Laurent Nkunda was arrested by Rwandan
  authorities in Rwanda in January 2009 and replaced as the commander of the CNDP. Since
  then, he has been under house arrest in Kigali, Rwanda. DRC Government’s request to
  extradite Nkunda for crimes committed in eastern DRC has been refused by Rwanda. In
  2010, Nkunda’s appeal for illegal detention was rejected by Rwandan court in Gisenyi,
  ruling that the matter should be examined by a military court. Nkunda’s lawyers appealed
  with the Rwandan Military Court. INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web link:https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/View-UN-Notices-Individuals
