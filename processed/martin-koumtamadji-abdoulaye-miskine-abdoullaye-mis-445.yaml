  Martin Koumtamadji founded the FDPC in 2005. He joined the Séléka
  coalition in December 2012 before leaving it in April 2013 after the rebels took power in Bangui.
  After being arrested in Cameroon, he was then transferred to Brazzaville in the Republic of
  Congo. He always remained in command of his troops on the ground in the CAR even when he
  was in Brazzaville before returning to the CAR (between November 2014 and 2019). The FDPC
  signed the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR on 6 February 2019 but
  Martin Koumtamadji remains a threat to the peace, stability and security of the CAR. Photo available
