remark: 'The Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry was created in 2013 for the purpose
  of modernizing the DPRK’s atomic energy industry to increase the production of nuclear
  materials, improve their quality, and further develop an independent DPRK nuclear
  industry. As such, the MAEI is known to be a critical player in the DPRK’s development
  of nuclear weapons and is in charge of day-to-day operation of the country’s nuclear
  weapons program, and under it are other nuclear-related organizations. Under this
  ministry are a number of nuclear-related organizations and research centers, as
  well as two committees: an Isotope Application Committee and a Nuclear Energy Committee.
  The MAEI also directs a nuclear research center at Yongbyun, the site of the DPRK''s
  known plutonium facilities. Furthermore, in the 2015 Panel of Experts (POE) report,
  the POE stated that Ri Je-son, a former director of the GBAE who was designated
  by the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006) in 2009 for engagement
  in or support for nuclear related programs, was appointed as head of the MAEI on
  April 9, 2014.'
