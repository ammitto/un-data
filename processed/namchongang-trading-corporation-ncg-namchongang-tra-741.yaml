remark: 'Namchongang is a DPRK trading company subordinate to the General Bureau of
  Atomic Energy (GBAE). Namchongang has been involved in the procurement of Japanese
  origin vacuum pumps that were identified at a DPRK nuclear facility, as well as
  nuclear-related procurement associated with a German individual. It has further
  been involved in the purchase of aluminum tubes and other equipment specifically
  suitable for a uranium enrichment program from the late 1990s. Its representative
  is a former diplomat who served as DPRK’s representative for the IAEA inspection
  of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities in 2007. Namchongang''s proliferation activities
  are of grave concern given the DPRK’s past proliferation activities. Telephone numbers:
