remark: As Chief of General Staff of the SPLA, Malong expanded or extended the conflict
  in South Sudan through breaches of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and breaches
  of the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS).
  He reportedly directed efforts to kill opposition leader Riek Machar. He ordered
  SPLA units to prevent the transport of humanitarian supplies. Under Malong’s leadership,
  the SPLA attacked civilians, schools and hospitals; forced the displacement of civilians;
  carried out enforced disappearances; arbitrarily detained civilians; and conducted
  acts of torture, and rape. He mobilized the Mathiang Anyoor Dinka tribal militia,
  which uses child soldiers. Under his leadership, the SPLA restricted UNMISS, the
  Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), and CTSAMM access to sites to
  investigate and document abuses.
