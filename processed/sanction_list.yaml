    in South Sudan through breaches of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and
    breaches of the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan
    (ARCSS). He reportedly directed efforts to kill opposition leader Riek Machar.
    He ordered SPLA units to prevent the transport of humanitarian supplies. Under
    Malong’s leadership, the SPLA attacked civilians, schools and hospitals; forced
    the displacement of civilians; carried out enforced disappearances; arbitrarily
    detained civilians; and conducted acts of torture, and rape. He mobilized the
    Mathiang Anyoor Dinka tribal militia, which uses child soldiers. Under his leadership,
    the SPLA restricted UNMISS, the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC),
    and CTSAMM access to sites to investigate and document abuses.
