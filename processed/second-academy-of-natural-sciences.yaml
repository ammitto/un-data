remark: The Second Academy of Natural Sciences is a national-level organization responsible
  for research and development of the DPRK’s advanced weapons systems, including missiles
  and probably nuclear weapons. The Second Academy of Natural Sciences uses a number
  of subordinate organizations to obtain technology, equipment, and information from
  overseas, including Tangun Trading Corporation, for use in the DPRK’s missile and
  probably nuclear weapons programs. Tangun Trading Corporation was designated by
  the Committee in July 2009 and is primarily responsible for the procurement of commodities
  and technologies to support DPRK’s defense research and development programs, including,
  but not limited to, weapons of mass destruction and delivery system programs and
  procurement, including materials that are controlled or prohibited under relevant
  multilateral control regimes.
